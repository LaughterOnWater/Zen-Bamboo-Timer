# Zen Bamboo Timer

A simple, beautiful, and fully responsive countdown timer that lives entirely in a single HTML file. It features a soothing "bamboo" chime generated by the Web Audio API, a responsive donut graph interface, and local storage presets.

## Features

*   **Visual Donut Interface:** Clean, minimalist SVG donut graph that visualizes time remaining.
*   **Responsive Design:** Automatically adjusts layout for portrait (vertical) and landscape (horizontal) orientations. The interface maintains aspect ratio and fits perfectly within the browser window.
*   **Bamboo Sound Engine:** A procedural sound using the Web Audio API that mimics a wooden bamboo block at 440Hz. No external audio files are required.
*   **Savable Presets:** Save your favorite timers (e.g., "Egg", "Pizza", "Nap") directly to your browser's LocalStorage.
*   **Interactive Controls:**
    *   **Tap:** Load a preset.
    *   **Long Press (Mobile) / Right Click (Desktop):** Delete a saved preset.
*   **Single File:** No dependencies, no build steps, no servers. Just download and open.

## Preview

> *Imagine a calming, clean interface split into two cards. On the left (or top), a large donut chart displaying the time. On the right (or bottom), a numeric keypad and playback controls. Soft muted greens and wood tones.*
